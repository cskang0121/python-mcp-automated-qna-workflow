# Python MCP Automated Q&A Workflow

> An open source hands-on learning project for Model Context Protocol (MCP). Build two MCP servers that enable Claude Desktop to automatically answer customer questions by searching context in relevant documentation and managing Q&A workflows through Google Sheets setup.

**Repository**: https://github.com/cskang0121/python-mcp-automated-qna-workflow

## Project Overview

This is an open-source learning project for understanding **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - the protocol that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with external systems and data sources.

## üéØ The Problem We're Solving

### The Customer Support Challenge

**Every business faces the same challenge:** Support teams spend 60-80% of their time answering the same questions repeatedly. This leads to:

- **Burnout and inefficiency** - Support agents answering "How do I reset my password?" for the 50th time today
- **Inconsistent responses** - Different agents giving slightly different answers to the same question
- **Scaling bottlenecks** - As your business grows, support costs grow linearly (or worse)
- **Knowledge silos** - Important information trapped in documents, wikis, and people's heads
- **Response delays** - Customers waiting hours or days for answers to simple questions

### Traditional Solutions Fall Short

**Static FAQs and Chatbots:** Rigid, hard to maintain, poor user experience
**Knowledge Bases:** Great for storage, but require customers to search and find answers themselves  
**Help Desk Software:** Organizes tickets but doesn't reduce the manual work
**Simple AI Chatbots:** Often give wrong answers because they lack access to current business data

### The MCP Advantage

This project demonstrates a **human-AI collaboration approach** where:

‚úÖ **AI handles the repetitive work** - Searches documentation, drafts consistent answers

‚úÖ **Humans provide oversight** - Review, approve, and handle complex cases  

‚úÖ **Real-time data access** - AI reads from live Google Sheets and current documentation

‚úÖ **Continuous learning** - Easy to update knowledge base as business evolves

‚úÖ **Cost-effective scaling** - Handle 10x more questions without hiring 10x more people

### Target Users

- **Small to medium businesses** looking to scale support efficiently
- **Support teams** overwhelmed with repetitive questions  
- **Developers** wanting to learn Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Anyone** managing Q&A workflows across teams

### The Business Problem We're Solving

This project demonstrates how MCP can automate repetitive customer support by:

1. **Connecting AI to multiple data sources** (Google Sheets + local documentation)
2. **Automating repetitive Q&A** while maintaining human oversight
3. **Creating a scalable support system** that learns from documentation

### How It Works

**Workflow:**
1. User questions arrive in Google Sheet
2. AI reads questions via Google Sheets MCP server
3. AI searches documentation via Knowledge Base MCP server
4. AI drafts answers for review
5. Approved answers are posted back to Google Sheet

- **Google APIs** - Sheets integration
- **asyncio** - Asynchronous operations

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11 or higher**
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should show 3.11+
   ```

2. **uv package manager**
   ```bash
   # Install uv (macOS/Linux)
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   
   # Or with pip
   pip install uv
   ```

3. **Claude Desktop App**

   - Required for MCP client functionality

4. **Google Cloud Account** (for Google Sheets integration)
   - Free tier is sufficient
   - Setup instructions in `google_sheets_mcp/README.md`

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cskang0121/python-mcp-automated-qna-workflow.git
cd python-mcp-automated-qna-workflow
```

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment at project root
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all dependencies
uv pip install mcp aiofiles  # For Knowledge Base server
uv pip install google-api-python-client google-auth python-dotenv  # For Google Sheets
```

### Step 3: Set Up Google Sheets Authentication
```bash
# Create .env file in google_sheets_mcp/
cd google_sheets_mcp
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Google Sheet ID and credentials path

# Note: Sample questions for your Google Sheet are in business_scenarios/sample-questions.csv
```

### Step 4: Configure Claude Desktop
1. Copy the example config file to Claude Desktop's config location:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Edit the config file and replace `/YOUR/PROJECT/PATH/` with your actual project path

See `claude_desktop_config.example.json` for the template configuration.

### Step 5: Prepare Test Data
```bash
# Sample documentation already exists in knowledge_base_mcp/data/
# Sample questions are available in business_scenarios/sample-questions.csv
# Copy them to your Google Sheet for testing
```

### Step 6: Run the Servers
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source .venv/bin/activate

# Terminal 1: Knowledge Base Server
cd knowledge_base_mcp
python src/server.py

# Terminal 2: Google Sheets Server (in new terminal)
source .venv/bin/activate
cd google_sheets_mcp
python src/server.py
```

## üéØ Common Challenges & Solutions

When working through this project, here are key points that will save you time:

### Virtual Environment Setup
- **Important**: Create the virtual environment at the project root, not in individual server directories
- Always activate the environment before running servers: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- If you see "command not found: python", use `python3` instead

### Claude Desktop Configuration
- **The config file doesn't exist by default** - use `claude_desktop_config.example.json` as a template
- **Config location varies by OS**:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
  - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Must use absolute paths** in the config, not relative paths
- **Completely restart Claude Desktop** after changing the config (Cmd+Q, not just closing the window)
- **Start a new conversation** to test MCP servers - old conversations won't see them

### Google Sheets Setup Tips
- **Service Account Email**: Find it in your `google-credentials.json` file under `"client_email"`
- **Sheet ID**: It's the long string in the URL between `/d/` and `/edit` 
  - Example: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID_HERE/edit`
- **Critical Step**: You MUST share your Google Sheet with the service account email (like sharing with a person)
- **Uncheck "Notify people"** when sharing - service accounts don't have email

### Testing Your Setup
- **Test without Claude first**: Run the test scripts to verify connections work
- **If MCP servers don't appear in Claude**:
  1. Check you fully restarted Claude Desktop
  2. Verify you're in a NEW conversation
  3. Confirm paths in config are absolute and correct
  4. Try asking "What MCP tools do you have access to?"

### Python Environment Issues
- **uv not found**: Install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Module not found errors**: Make sure you activated the virtual environment
- **Permission denied**: The paths in Claude config might be wrong

### Debugging MCP Servers
- Servers run silently - no output means they're working
- To see debug output: `MCP_DEBUG=true python src/server.py`
- Check if server imports work: `python -c "from src.server import server"`
